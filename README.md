# AI for 2048 game

## How to install and run the program
### AI mode
We have implemented our AI for the 2048 game in Python. <br>
Python 3.7 or higher is required to run our program. <br>
If you do not have Python 3.7 (or higher) installed, you can find instructions to get it here: [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

To run the program, open a terminal in this directory and run the following command:

**windows**:<br>
Either
```cmd
py -3 ai.py
```
or
```cmd
python ai.py
```

**linux** (and mac*):
```bash
python3 ai.py
```


### Manual play (simplified game)
If you want to play the game yourself - instead of the AI, like before you need Python 3.7+ installed.<br>
Like before, you need a terminal open in this directory, then run the following command:

**windows**:<br>
Either
```cmd
py -3 logic.py
```
or
```cmd
python logic.py
```

**linux** (and mac*):
```bash
python3 logic.py
```


*We do not own a computer with Mac OS, but since it is unix based, like linux, we think it should work if using the linux syntax
